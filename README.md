## Hybrid AI-Enhanced Network Intrusion Detection System

---

##  Overview

The **Hybrid AI-Enhanced Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** is a cybersecurity project designed to monitor network traffic in real time and detect malicious activities using a combination of:

* 🔹 Rule-Based Detection (Signature Matching)
* 🔹 AI-Based Anomaly Detection (Machine Learning)

This hybrid approach allows the system to detect both **known attacks** and **unknown (zero-day) threats**, making it more effective than traditional IDS systems.

##  Features

* 📡 Real-time packet capture using **Scapy**
* 🧠 Machine Learning-based anomaly detection (Isolation Forest)
* 📜 Rule-based detection for common attacks:

  * Port Scanning
  * Brute Force Login
  * Suspicious Port Access
  * ICMP Flood
  * DDoS Behavior
* ⚠️ Real-time alert generation with severity levels
* 🗄️ Logging system using **SQLite / CSV**
* 🌐 Web dashboard using **Flask + Chart.js**
* 📊 Visualization of network activity and attack patterns

---

##  System Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture:

1. **Data Collection Layer**

   * Packet capture
   * Flow monitoring

2. **Preprocessing Layer**

   * Feature extraction
   * Data normalization

3. **Detection Layer**

   * Rule-based detection
   * AI anomaly detection

4. **Decision & Alert Layer**

   * Threat classification
   * Severity scoring
   * Logging

5. **Visualization Layer**

   * Dashboard for monitoring
